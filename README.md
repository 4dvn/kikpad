# KIKPAD
KiKPad : the Midiplus SmartPad reinvented !  

<img alt="SmartPad from Midiplus" style="border-width:0" src="http://www.midiplus.com/images/xpad-1.jpg" /></a>

We did it again ! 

The KikGen Labs proposes again a firmware entirely rewritten for a commercial product.  This time it is the **Smartpad** from Midiplus, which technical characteristics being very close to the Launchpad from Novation.  

At this stage, the firmware is an advanced prototype, with all pads, 64 RGB colors, encoders, buttons operationals, including midi.   
The perspectives offered by this new firmware are vast: fully customized Ableton Live controller, chord generator, autonomous sequencer, master keyboard , etc....

I want to thank here DerFetzer for his similar project (developed in Rust) and the impulse he gave me for the launch of this project realized under "lockdown " !  have a look here : https://github.com/DerFetzer/open-cleverpad
